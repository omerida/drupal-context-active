drupal-context-active
=====================

Minimal module to display a block listing any active contexts on a page.

To use, enable the module, then go to Structure > Blocks and add it to a region. You can also control who sees the information by restricting it by role.

There is a similar module at https://drupal.org/project/context_list_active, but that depends on another module and provides a richer view of the active contexts.
